# Kickstarter-Analysis

Summary: Organized and analyzed a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.


Sheet1 - Conditionally formatted State column, created a new Column O to calculate Percent Funded and conditionally formatted using  a three color scale.  Created new Column P to caluculate Average Donation per kickstart.  Created two new Columns at Q and R to   split the Category and Subcategory column into two parts.  Created a new column S named Date Created Conversion and Date Ended  Conversion which converted Unix timestamps. 

Sheet2 - Created a pivot table to analyze the initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.   Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the pivot table created.

Sheet 3 - Created a pivot table to analyze the initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category. Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table you have created.

Sheet 4 - Created a pivot table with a column of state, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of state, and filters based on parent category and Years.  Created a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table. Wrote a report in Microsoft Word based on the pivot table data data drawing 3 conclusions, listing limitations of the dataset, and discussing other possible graphs and tables that could be used.

Sheet 5 - Created a new sheet with 8 columns, and 12 rows and formulated a Countif function to count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the ranges. Calcuated the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range. Created a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goalâ€™s amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.

Sheet 6 - Created a new worksheet and made a column for both the number of backers of successful campaigns and unsuccessful campaigns. Evaluated the following for successful campaigns, and then for unsuccessful campaigns: mean,median,mode, minimum , maximum, variance, and standard deviation of the number of backers.  Summarized data in textboox.
